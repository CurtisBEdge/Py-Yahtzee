# Py-Yahtzee
Simple Yahtzee game for up to 4 players

The first language I started to learn was Python, and this is the first project I tried independently.
It currently needs refactoring, as the naming conventions aren't Pythonic.

I am currently working through adding AI players, which is challenging due to the amount of desicion making within the game.
I'm having a lot of fun working out how to do it.

In the future I'd like to try and add AI players using machine learning.
